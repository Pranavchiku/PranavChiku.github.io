            <h3>Building SciPy & ImpliedDoLoops</h3>
            <h6>Date: July 23, 2023.</h6>
            <p>
                Hii there! Welcome to blog of week 10. This week I continued implementation of ImpliedDoLoops made a decent
                progress over it and also somehow manage to get SciPy Specfun build and run tests with LFortran.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's pick up ImpliedDoLoops from where we left, we had initial implementation of implied do loops ready, but it lacked
                support for nested implied do loops, accessing array elements, variables casting, etc. So, I started workin on it and provided
                support for these. Later, I realised that exisiting implementation of implied do loops was working fine for few cases that latest
                implementation was not able to handle. So, I decided to keep both implementations and first apply exisiting approach and then
                the latest one. This worked fine and I was able to pass all tests. You can have a look at it <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1993">PR: 1993</a>.
                But, I am not satisfied with this approach as it is not a clean implementation and also it is not very efficient. So, I am still
                working on it and will try to come up with a better approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, with help from Ondřej Čertík, I was able to get SciPy Specfun build and run tests with LFortran. We had to comment and remove
                few tests as they were not compatible with LFortran. You can track the progress at <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1979">Issue: 1979</a>.
                We planned to setup CI for Specfun in this week, but I was unable to do that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This week I was unable to give much time to GSoC due to some personal reasons, worked only for 12.5 hours. For next week I will try to
                setup CI for Specfun and also work on ImpliedDoLoops. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to thank
                <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/">Ondřej Čertík</a> for taking
                out time and helping me when I was stuck. Looking forward to many
                more commits.
              </p>
