                    <h3>Implement COMMON block</h3>
                    <h6>Date: May 21, 2023.</h6>
                    <p>
                        Hii, welcome to the very first blog of my GSoC'23 journey. I will be working to get LFortran compile 
                        the fortran codebase of <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy">SciPy</a>. To begin with this, I figured out
                        the major bugs in the codebase that is preventing LFortran to compile it and one of them was the use of COMMON block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might be wondering why to use COMMON block when we have modules and classes in fortran. Well, the answer is
                        simple, COMMON block is a way to share data between different subroutines and functions. It is a global variable
                        that can be accessed by any subroutine or function. It is a very old way of sharing data and is not recommended
                        to use it in modern fortran code. But, SciPy is a very old codebase and it is not possible to change the whole
                        codebase to use modules and classes. So, we have to use COMMON block to share data between different subroutines
                        and functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with an example to understand how COMMON block works. Suppose we have two subroutines, one to read
                        the data and other to print the data. We want to share the data between these two subroutines. So, we will use
                        COMMON block to share the data. We will declare a COMMON block in both the subroutines and use it to share the
                        data. You can refer to the code snippet below to understand how to it is done, where r() represents read subroutine
                        and w() represents write subroutine. We use COMMON block `block` to share the data between these two subroutines.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, let us proceed to the implementation part. During this week, I mainly focused on successfull parsing to AST and then 
                        implementation of conversion of AST to ASR. On starting with the implementation, I realised that there are a few cases that current parser
                        is unable to parse, example of such case is shown below: <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1653">Issue: 1653</a>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/fcfdbdc344780837125e6ccb37d20898.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On observing we realised that if we added a `,` after declaration of a COMMON block, then it was parsed successfully. So, we decided to
                        tweak exisiting fixed-form parser to handle this case. We added a `,` after declaration of COMMON block and then parsed it successfully.
                        More details about it can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1655">PR: 1655</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this, we started working on conversion of AST to ASR. It was an iterative approach we started off by creating a local hash table that 
                        contains `std::string common_block_name` as key and `std::vector<\ASR::expr_t*> common_block_variables` as value. Upon encounter of a 
                        COMMON block, we populated the hash table and then at the end of every program unit, we create an `ASR::Module_t` with 
                        `common_block_variables` as public variables. Simply, we tried to perform the conversion shown below:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/c67651394ece860944c5121c3e4e7d1e.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this failed as we realised that COMMON block variables can't be declared like this inside module. We need to have these variables inside
                        struct and then use that struct as public variable which is present inside module as shown below:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/44fcee90ff9390f37eb0a4b5b17b2c8c.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On further investigation we realised that to impose restrictions over decalration of COMMON blocks and to verify the correctness of declaration, 
                        we need to have `Union` of structs inside module as public variable and then access it. Assuming that the codebase of SciPy is correct, we decided
                        to avoid this step and move forward with simple struct inside module based implemenation. Now in body of the program, we need to replace all the 
                        positions where common block variables is used with StructAccessMember present in ASR node of LFortran.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Summarizing  20.5 hours of this week work, we were able to parse COMMON block, populate hash table and create an `ASR::Module_t` with `ASR::StructType_t` inside
                        it as public variable, which contains all the variables of COMMON block. Further more, we were able to replace common block variables with
                        StructAccessMember for assignments. But, we are still working to make it more robust and generic. All the Issues and PRs can be found below:
