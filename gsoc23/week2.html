                    <h3>Continuation of COMMON block</h3>
                    <h6>Date: May 29, 2023.</h6>
                    <p>
                        Hello! May 28, 2023 marked the end of second week of GSoC'23. In this week I continued working on the implementation of COMMON block.
                        Majorly I focused on getting common block variables replaced with StructAccessMember in the body of the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start simple I decided to work on getting common block variables in assignments replaced with StructAccessMember. On observation, 
                        we found that we have to do it every time we "resolve" a variable / array. I used `replace_with_common_block_variables` function to
                        replace common block variables with StructAccessMember. This function takes `ASR::expr_t*` as input and returns replaced `ASR::expr_t*` as output.
                        For example:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/69aa9e29440f0def7e34dcc27108d75c.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The above code snippet translates to the following fortran code:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/d439633ae77e39cc83af1efa84c4a465.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially a COMMON module was created and populated with StructType_t, which contains all variables of COMMON blocks. Then in `ast_body_visitor`
                        I used `replace_with_common_block_variables` to replace Variable_t and ArrayItem_t with StructAccessMember_t. This was done by checking if the
                        variable is present in the hash table or not. If it is present then we replace it with StructAccessMember_t. With this ASR implementation of 
                        COMMON block was completed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>ASR to LLVM</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first issue for ASR to LLVM conversion was <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1703">Issue: 1703</a> that was because
                        of wrong addition of `ASR::StructType_t.m_name` to dependencies of `ASR::Module_t` created. Second was <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1684">Issue: 1684</a>
                        which was because of not adding variable names to dependencies of `ASR::StructType_t` created. Both of these issues were fixed throught <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1706">PR: 1706</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later on we realised that LFortran is unable to compile the translated code to LLVM (<a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1723">Issue: 1723</a>) which needs to be fixed for 
                        successfull compilation of ASR to LLVM code. We are still working on it and will be fixed soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, I worked for 13 hours this week and was able to complete ASR implementaiton of COMMON block. I also worked on ASR to LLVM conversion
                        but was unable to complete it. All the Issues and PRs can be found below:
