                    <p>
                        Hello everyone! Week 12, last week of my GSoC journey. This week I worked on getting SciPy build
                        in my system and also fixed some bugs in LFortran.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with SciPy build, after discussion with Ondřej Čertík, we decided to open an issue
                        at SciPy
                        stating them the problem that I am facing while building SciPy. The issue can be found at <a
                            href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/19017">Issue: 19017</a>. In short, the error
                        that I faced
                        was `AssertionError: Bad argument number for Assign: 3, expecting 2`. At first site it looked
                        like a
                        problem with gast version, but later we found that trouble is in installation of mambaforge. I
                        mistakenly
                        installed mambaforge-pypy3 and not mambaforge. Thanks to Ondřej Čertík for pointing out the
                        error, and then
                        on successful installation of mambaforge from <a
                            href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge">miniforge#mambaforge</a>
                        SciPy build was successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving ahead, I implemented a new flag `--use-loop-variable-after-loop` which is used to decide
                        whether to use
                        loop variable after loop or not. In continuation of work from previous week <a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/2079">PR: 2079</a>,
                        we decided to hide the implementation under a flag. The PR can be found at <a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/2081">PR: 2081</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I worked on <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1977">Issue: 1977</a>
                        which is about handling of external functions in LFortran.
                        Let us take the minimal example to understand the problem:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/46703c34838da120d4386449939af857.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we look at the code, `f` is an external function with no exisiting implementation and hence
                        we need use the standard template `f` created
                        while handling external functions and hence ASR generates correctly. For LLVM, we have `f` type
                        mentioned as Interface and hence compiler donot
                        generate function code, then it is passed in as a subroutine call argument and here the compiler
                        askes generated code but as there is no code generated
                        it throws an error. The solution to this problem is:
                        When visiting the function dqc25f in the body visitor, check if there are any external symbols
                        in it. If so, resolve them fully, that is, find f in the global symbol table, if available,
                        update the interface stub to be conforming. If it is not available, then don't do anything,
                        since the function f will be linked in a separate compilation, in which case it's fine if the
                        type doesn't match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next up, I worked on <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/2086">Issue: 2086</a>,
                        which catches an inefficient implementation of data statement in LFortran. Let us take a look at
                        the example:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/d732a41870eb77f830008c8cfb512fd3.js"></script>
                        The problem here is that current implementation of data statement adds Integer 2, 3350 times to
                        the list at compile time.
                        This produces a very hefty around 24,000+ lines of code in LLVM which then takes a lot of time
                        to compile. A solution to This
                        is to create a do loop for assignment to vect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So with 16.5 hours this week, I was able to get SciPy build and also fixed some bugs in
                        LFortran. All in all for entire 12 weeks, I completed
                        248.5 hours out of 175 hours and get LFortran compile entire codebase of SciPy to ASR, 77.995%
                        files to LLVM :)). I would like to thank
                        <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/">Ondřej Čertík</a> for helping me throughout my GSoC journey.
                        I would also like to thank
                        Thirumalai Shaktivel, Gagandeep Singh, Ubaid Saikh, Smit Lunagaria and all other members of
                        LFortran community for helping me
                        and guiding me whenever I was stuck. I would also like to thank Google for giving me this
                        opportunity to work with LFortran.
                    </p>
