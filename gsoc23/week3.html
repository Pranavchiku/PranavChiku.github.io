                    <p>
                        Welcome back to the third blog of my GSoC '23 journey. This week I worked majorly to pick and fix bugs related to COMMON blocks. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Picking up the last week work on <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1723">Issue: 1723</a> which was about LFortran not
                        being able to identify struct members. On discussion with Ondrej we found that the fix was hidden in `visit_Variable` function of asr_to_llvm.cpp.
                        It got fixed by adding provision to intialize non c_ptr structs while visiting them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1731">PR: 1731</a> we were able to make COMMON blocks work with LLVM backend. On increasing 
                        the complexity of tests we found that code was not able to compile for case in which arrays are part of common block and are used in the program. We have 
                        <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1734">Issue: 1734</a> dedicated to it, digging deep we found that LFortran is unable to access 
                        the arrays defined inside module, the use case supported right now is arrays declared and used inside functions/subroutines and the main program itself. Whereas
                        we are trying to access the array defined inside module from main program. We are still working on it and will be fixed soon. A dedicated issue for it is
                        <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1735">Issue: 1735</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To utilize the time efficiently we decided to scan SciPy and see if we are missing any edge cases, doing so we caught <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1715">Issue: 1715</a>.
                        It is about, the common block declares an array, the type declared in the function does not mention the dimension, so we need to get the dimension from the common block. This was fixed by 
                        <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1738">PR: 1738</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, there were few other issues reported and fixed like <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1728">Issue: 1728</a>,
                        <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/175">Issue: 1755</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1756">Issue: 1756</a>, and many
                        not registered which are fixed by <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1754">PR: 1754</a>. All these are mostly the edge cases which were missed
                        during initial implementation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1754">PR: 1754</a> and 24 hours of work this week, I was able to compile COMMON blocks present in SciPy codebase completely to ASR
                        and the cases which exclude array inside COMMON blocks to LLVM aswell. 
                        I would like to thank <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/">Ondřej Čertík</a> for taking out time and helping me when I was stuck. Looking forward to many more commits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the next week, I will try to get <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1734">Issue: 1734</a> fixed, apart from this I will try to get implementation of Union of structs if doable quickly else 
                        now we have sufficient infrastructure to proceed on Block_Data() implementation, so I will start working on it.
                    </p>
