            <h3>Bug fixes SciPy & Block Data</h3>
            <h6>Date: June 11, 2023.</h6>
            <p>
              Hello! Welcome to the fourth blog of my GSoC '23 journey. This
              week was based on fixing bugs and getting the statements and
              declarations present inside Block_Data() to ASR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with Block Data, it is a Fortran 77 feature which is
              used to initialize variables and arrays. It is similar to the main
              program but it is executed before the main program. It is used to
              initialize the variables and arrays which are used in the main
              program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Block Data is used at only few places in SciPy codebase, and as we
              have implementation of COMMON block and Data statements ready, I
              thought it would be a good idea to get Block Data implemented. We
              started with the declarations and body of block data, took every
              combination of it and fixed the bugs which were not supported by
              LFortran. The two major bugs were, improper handling of COMMON
              blocks with no name and second was allowing struct instance member
              to be used inside data statements. This was fixed by
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1763"
                >PR: 1763</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              With this, we were able to get the declarations and statements of
              block data to ASR and as we have implementation of COMMON blocks
              and Data statements, we were able to get the declarations and
              statements of block data to LLVM aswell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still we have to find a way to declare `block data` in ASR, which
              we can do either by adding a new node or by using the existing
              nodes. We are still working on it and will be fixed soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving ahead, we decided to scan SciPy and see if we are missing
              any edge cases, doing so we caught various issues like handling of
              external functions, statement functions, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us begin with `external` declarations, a small example is
              shown below:
              <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/ee2736652e9d006d60f6f9f42fb4cf53.js"></script>
              Previously, LFortran used to ignore external declaratios which
              resulted in
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1753"
                >Issue: 1753</a
              >,
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1776"
                >Issue: 1776</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this declaration we donot have any idea about what function
              `matvect` can be, how many arguments it will have, etc. So we
              decided to create a template function with everything nullptr
              and/or 0 and then fill it up when we get the definition of the
              function. This was done in
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1789"
                >PR: 1789</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              On moving ahead, we encountered
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1441"
                >Issue: 1441</a
              >
              which is shown below:
              <script src="https://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/ba5aa430f882a742a0b75b6569c0c71e.js"></script>
              In the above example, argument of `sub2` i.e. `c` is a double
              precision variable when compiler visits a subroutine call, but on
              moving ahead we encounter that `c` is an implicit function with
              type `double precision`. So we created a template function
              `update_call_args` that updates `sub2` to use the new symbol `c`
              that is now a function, not a variable. This was done in
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1792"
                >PR: 1792</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              On further scanning we encountered various bugs related to
              statement functions, those were fixed through
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1794"
                >PR: 1794</a
              >
              more information about it can be found in PR itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, there were some bugs related to implicit declarations
              along with external and statement functions which got fixed by
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1800"
                >PR: 1800</a
              >,
              <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1802"
                >PR: 1802</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all with 23 hours of work, we were able to compile
              `Quadpack`, `Odepack`, `statlib` completely to ASR. For the next
              week I am planning to focus more on this bug hunting and fixing
              along with implementation of block data, data implied do loop (if
              possible), save attribute and some more edge cases. I would like
              to thank
              <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/">Ondřej Čertík</a> for taking
              out time and helping me when I was stuck. Looking forward to many
              more commits.
